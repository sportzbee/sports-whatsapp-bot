How it works.

Server :
- localhost: 3000/webhook
  - gets the question.
  - asks tavily for answers.
  - converts the summary into openAI.
- localhost routes all localhost:3000 to a ngrok endpoint.
- user -> gives a question in whatsapp phone number.
- number -> is registered to Twilio, it routes incoming message to ngrok server, and then to localhost
    : Twilio has route incoming msg to a endpoint post.
- ngrok passes the request to localserv /webhook post.
- Request comes to server Uses tavily to


whatsApp -> Twilio -> ngrok -> localhost.
